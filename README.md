# AI-Based Resume Scanner for Job Applications

AI Resume Scanner is a Python-based web application that enables recruiters to post job listings and automatically match submitted resumes using an AI-powered scoring system. Applicants can browse and apply for jobs by uploading their resumes directly through the portal. The app uses BERT embeddings and a logistic regression model to evaluate resume-job relevance. It features separate dashboards for recruiters and applicants, with built-in resume analysis and secure authentication.
